# Reflective: Book Alterities

## Is Book Alterities a Genre?

I've left this week more confused by what the genre of Book Alterities is than I was before this week. My preconception of Book Alterities were primarily infomred by Kit Davey's Instagram before this week. This notion was reinforced by about half of the books discussed in the readings and a few of the books shown in the Archives. 

My definintion of Altered Books matches Lisa Vollrath's definiton in a Crash Course on Altered Books - "an altered book is an art object that has been created from an existing, printed book." This definition fits Kit Davey's instagram, Tom Phillip's A Humument, and the Science book in the NuArchives (I've forgotten its name, the one with the flowers and etc inside). 

Works that we have grouped together as book alterities that do not fit my definition of altered books are The Xenotext works,The Future Library, Boundless, and S by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dourst. The books of the Future library I would argue are simply Books. The Project itself is innovative but except for their delayed publication the books of the future library do not dramatically differ from our standard defintion of books today. S does not fit my definiton becasue The Ship of Theseus is a novel created by the authors of S for S. I would classify the ship if theseus as a book in the genre of experimental novel.I honeslty still can't wrap my head around the Xenotext work. I do not know if it is a book, science experiment, or both. The one thing I do know is BÃ¶k did not alter any books to make it so it is not an Altered book. Boundless as a book themed art object is the closest to an altered book but  again like the rest of these counter examples Boundless does not fit the definiton because an existing book was not altered.

I wish we were able to spend a little more time on Book Alterities this week but I know this was not possible with the shortened week and the survey nature of the course. To answer my own question from the title, no Book alterities is too broad a term to be a genre if everything presented this week is a Book Alterity. Altered Books is a distinct genre of art, not literature. Book Alterities seems to encompass both.
