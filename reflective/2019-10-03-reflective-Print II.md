## My first experiance with Letterpress

After our initial introduction to print last week, I thought I had a good idea of how letterpress worked. From an abstract perspective I did. I understood the invention of letterpress in Europe and how it radically changed book production, turning books into mass produceable commodities and simulatenously democratizing book production by moving it away from the church. Until I worked with the type I didn't really understand the process. 

Working with type showed me the limitations of the form, how you are constrained by the fonts and symbols in your typeshop and how long a tedious a process composing type can be. I could not imagine the time commitment of composing an entire book. Once I got to work with the press I was able to experiance its true speed and how revolutionary it must've been in the 15th century. 

Of course, the press we have on campus is from the 19th century and I imagine faster than Guttenberg's press but the experiance of reproducing something you just took a long time creating in 2% of the time of the original is great. 

I made a comment on thursday that the printing press on campus seems more advanced than the Mac 2 we have. I think this arises from my main impression of each technology. I use modern computers everyday and the Mac 2 is simply an early, inferior iteration of that technology. My main idea of a printing press was closer to Guttenberg's press. I still picture a 18th century press as the standard printing press so experiancing an press a century advanced from my expectations at one of the final stages of a press seems more advanced than an early iteration of a technology I use every day.
