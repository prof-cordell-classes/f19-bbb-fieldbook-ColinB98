# Reflective: E-Lit 2

## E-lit part 2

FLores's Third Generation Electronic Literature was a good reading to sum up the shift in electronic literature overtime and our own shift in discussing E-lit. In E-lit. week one our discussion focused on first mostly second generation e-lit. The peice we spent the most time on, Bois's "What Football Will Look Like in the Future" is a good example of second generation literature, a web-based multi-media story. In Week two's readings "First Screening" and "The Agrippa Files" are examples of first generation e-lit. "etheric ocean" and much of the Electronic Literature collection and porpentine games are second generation e-lit. "The Deletionist" and the twitterbots we examined in class are third generation e-lit. 

Each generation pushes the defininition of a book a little further. The first generation mostly resembled a book form and possess quirks of the electronic systems first generation authors were able to take advantage of such as "The Agrippa Files"' disappearing act. The second generation was able to include multi-media in the works and seperate itself form a physical form such as a disk. The second generation's loss of physicallity and inclusion of things like video challanged the traditional definiton of a book but still fits my definition of a book. The third generation of e-lit is where I no longer consider the works books. For example, "The Deletionist" is almost an electronic version of an deletion poetry artist book but since it is a function that you can run on any webpage without any realation to prior iterations of "The Deletionist". 

My definition of a book that I presented is "A book is a portable colection of literature, art, and/or infomration for a reader to interact with, bound together for a unified purpose. "The Deletionist" fails this definiton in my mind becasue it lacks a unified purpose. The team behind "The Deletionist" gave the tool a set of instructions to create poems but to the reader who applies the tool the results are basically random and since "The Deletionist" is something that can be used on an ongoing basis it will not become a book unless someone specifically creates a collection of sites that were altered by "The Deletionist". 

I feel similarly about the twitterbots we looked at in class this week. The only bot I considered a book was Pentametron's twitterpage read as one work. Pentametron was able to create a single collection of tweets to create essentially a giant found poem. The rest of the bots were not meant to be viewed as one thye were meant to integrate into a reader's twitter feed and exist as standalone tweets. 

Overall, these last two weeks have convinced me that e-literature is the arena where the book form is being pushed forward but I feel that e-literature in the third generation has pushed beyond the book form and has created its own way of conveying literature/art/information.
