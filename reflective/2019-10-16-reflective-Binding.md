# Reflective: Binding

#### Colin Byrnes

## Binding and Letterpress: Taking the time to appreciate the form.

The reading prep for this week was my favorite so far. I really loved Baxter's Procustes. The reading was divided between letterpress and bookbinding and initially I found that odd I expected more on the technical side of book binding. 

After reflection on this week's reading after binding on thursday I understand the readings more. Baxter's Procuste's preoccupation with the binding of a wordless book and Lindsay Schmittle's 6 month journey to find printing material are about the thought and effort that go into often overlooked features of a book. 

Having worked with letterpress a few weeks ago and binding this week I find myself paying attention to aspects of a book I in the past overlooked like font and how a book is bound. This week's reading and classwork was a clear example of a theme that has run throughout this class, there is someone behind all the decisions that go into the production of the book, could be the author, publisher, Linsday Schmittle, or memebers of the Bodleian Club and each person invovled in the process takes the time to make a choice that supports thier artistic or commercial goals for the book. As a reader, taking the time to consider a book beyond the words on a page is what the most valuable thing I've taken away from this class so far.
