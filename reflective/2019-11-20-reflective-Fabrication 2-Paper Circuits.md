# Reflective: Fabrication II: Paper Circuits

## Paper Circuits

I thought 'Bibliocircuitry and the Design of the Alien Everyday' and 'Thinking as Handwork: Criticl Making with Humanistic Concerns' were good choices for the final readings. Critical Making and Reflective Design were concepts that cleary influenced the shape of this course. These final readings served well as a mini-summation of the course in addition to introducing paper circuits and physical books with electronic parts.

The books presented in 'Bibliocircuitry...' were presented as e-books but to me e-books are distributed electronically not simply books that include electronic elements. I would classify the books presented as artist books. As we've moved through this semester, I've attributed increasing importance to a book's distrobution. The books presented in 'Bibliocircuitry...' being one-off works was one of the biggest factors in my classification of them as artist books. Electronics have been integrated into mass produced books, especially children's books, but I am aware of none produced in a way that attempts to replace the codex.  

Paper circuitry is something that is better suited for integration into a convnetional codex form than trailblazing a new form of book. Paper circuitry is a complimentary technology for the codex not a threatneing one.
