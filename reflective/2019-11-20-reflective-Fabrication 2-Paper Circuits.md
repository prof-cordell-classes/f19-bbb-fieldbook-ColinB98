# Reflective: Fabrication II: Paper Circuits

## Paper Circuits

I thought 'Bibliocircuitry and the Design of the Alien Everyday' and 'Thinking as Handwork: Criticl Making with Humanistic Concerns' were good choices for the final readings. Critical Making and Reflective Design were concepts that cleary influenced the shape of this course. These final readings served well as a mini-summation of the course in addition to introducing paper circuits and physical books with electronic parts. 

When I first read the readings I thought They would've been good introductory readings for this course because they were good summations and provided us with vocabulary for ideas we've discussed throughout this course. After reflection this week I changed my mind and appreicated these readings as the final readings of the course. At the end of this course I was in a better place to understand and appreicate these readings and to comprehend how these readings' philospohies, critical making and Reflective design, were so valuable for this course.

The books presented in 'Bibliocircuitry...' were presented as e-books but to me e-books are distributed electronically not simply books that include electronic elements. I would classify the books presented as artist books. As we've moved through this semester, I've attributed increasing importance to a book's production and distrobution. The evolution of the production and distrobution of book has been the driving force the has differentiatied generations of books. From generations of e-books to paperbacks vs. manuscripts copied by monks, the modes of production and distrobution pre-dated evolutions in content. The books presented in 'Bibliocircuitry...' being one-off works was one of the biggest factors in my classification of them as artist books. A book produced as a single object, instead of as a vector for the transmission of information, is a shift in purpose that indicates to me that a work is an artist book. Even though none were demonstrated in the reading, electronics have been integrated into mass produced books, especially children's books, but I am aware of none produced in a way that attempts to replace or reinvent the codex.  

Paper circuitry is something that is better suited for integration into a convnetional codex form than trailblazing a new form of book. Paper circuitry is a complimentary technology for the codex not a threatneing one. Their is alot of potential in paper circuitry to expand what is possible with a codex but after our weeks on E-lit I am underwhelmed.
