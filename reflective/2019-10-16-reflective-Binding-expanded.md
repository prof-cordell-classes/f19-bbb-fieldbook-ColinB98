# Reflective: Binding

## Binding and Letterpress: Taking the time to appreciate the form.

The reading prep for this week was my favorite so far. I really loved Baxter's Procustes. It was well written and clever. I hoped it was a true story and googled the story and author to find out. I was disappointed to learn it was fiction but its true context as a satirical retort to discrimination Chestnutt experianced is almost as good. Baxter's Procustes has slightly differnce relevacne to our class. It shows how even an empty book can be valuable: through the artistry of the binding and its novelty/association with a larger story (Baxter dupeing the Bodelian Club). 

The reading was divided between letterpress and bookbinding and initially I found that odd I expected more on the technical side of book binding. After reflection on this week's reading after binding on thursday I understand the readings more. Baxter's Procuste's preoccupation with the binding of a wordless book and Lindsay Schmittle's 6 month journey to find printing material are about the thought and effort that go into often overlooked features of a book. Often when a reader picks up a book they only focus on the words and they negelect to appreciate the artistry and effort that goes into all the other facets of a book, especially the binding. 

Having worked with letterpress a few weeks ago and binding this week I find myself paying attention to aspects of a book I in the past overlooked like font and how a book is bound. This week's reading and classwork was a clear example of a theme that has run throughout this class, there is someone behind all the decisions that go into the production of the book, could be the author, publisher, Linsday Schmittle, or memebers of the Bodleian Club and each person invovled in the process takes the time to make a choice that supports thier artistic or commercial goals for the book. As a reader, taking the time to consider a book beyond the words on a page is what the most valuable thing I've taken away from this class so far. 

This week has also shifted my definition of a book. I have not settled on a final definiton yet, but any definition I develop needs to include blank books. Book's like Baxter's or notebooks and planners do not contain any information, stories, or artwork in their pages, but I still consider them books. When you look beyond the blank pages there is artwork in the Book and the blank pages hold more potential than any written work.
