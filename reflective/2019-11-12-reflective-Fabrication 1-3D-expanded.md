## 3D Printing: Cool Tech, Limited impact on Books

This week's readings showed just how many things 3D printing can produce and how it is potentially revolutionary in many feilds. The revolutionary nature of 3D printing is shown by the Smithsonian publishing 3D printable scans of the Lincoln Life mask. Publishing these scans allows for anyone with access to 3D printing to access this artifact (in a way). 3D printing has the potential to decentralize global production. One area that 3D printing is currently incapable of revamping is bookmaking. 

The wide range of things on display in the 3D printing studio at Snell was impressive but in its current state 3D printing is not where the boundaries of what is a book will be pushed. E-lit has the same key advantage as 3D printing, easy distrobution of content over the internet and e-lit achieves that distrobution at a lower cost. Unless someone develops a new form of book, probably something reminiscent of the clay tablets ancient mesopatamians used to write Cuniform on, a 3D printed codex will not surpass the tradtional form. The modern codex is a technology that has developed over a thousand years, there may be marginal innovations to be made, but the codex is a stable form and one not well suited to 3D printing. E-lit is a bookform still developing and where there is room for major innnovations. 

Arad's 3D printed book is the exception that proves the rule. The first 3D printed book was a large undertaking that pushed 3D printing to its own boundaries. A Codex is not a form well suited to 3D printing. Since 3D printed objects are printed as one solid object a 3D printed codex is much stiffer to handle than a traditonal codex. Until 3D Printing can match the logistical ease of creating a work of e-lit digitally and the quality of a traditional codex 3D printed books will remain a novelty.
