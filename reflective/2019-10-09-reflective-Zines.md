## Scattered Reflection on Zines 

Last week's discussion of Zines was very interesting. The content within the Zines we discussed was often interesting but I found the indivduals and networks of Zine readers and makers to be even more intersting. Pagan's book and Giordana's collection and experiance in Zines was especially valuable in understanding the world of Zines. 

Pagan's book and especially Giordana's collection of Zines and our discussion arising from her collection showed me how people outside of the cirlces of tradiontal publishing could express themselves through Zines. Zines' handmade appearnce and personal distrobution really add to the effect of the Zines. The Zines in Giordana's collection are an amazing record of thier time and could only be produced in that time. That Zines were popular with counter-culture and marginalized groups makes alot of sense and it is amazing that we will be preserving the personal perspectives of these people. History is often "written by the victor" or at least the only people who can get published so it is spectacular that future genreations will be able to observe the personal publications of poeple whose perspectives otherwise may have been lost.  

I was struck by the local nature of Zines. Today, social media can be accessed almost anywhere in the world. I can follow my friends anywhere. Pagan's Zine documenting her trip to Gatilnburg, TN and her friends in other cities in the country reciving her Zines by mail proves this was also possible with zines. The diference is in the discovery of new content. Scrolling social media, I am just as likly to see a post from California as I am from Boston. Giordana's collection of Zines was almst entirly from other Zine makers in Boston. That is not unsurprising after taking a moment to think about who she would've known how she would've accquired them but appears odd in today's world of social media.
   

Today Zines heavily overlap with social media, tumbler is the site that comes to mind for me but the Zine has not completely disappeared. I attribute this too the particular artistic options avalible in Zines, especially their found nature and tactile experiance. I also believe that Zines can be more private than social media and the added effort that goes into Zines add importance to the content within. 

Zines are not a form of book I have any interest in producing or even consuming but are a form of book that are a pure expression of the time that produced them. I hope more librarians like Giordana are able to preserve Zines.
