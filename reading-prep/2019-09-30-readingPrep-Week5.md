# Reading Prep: Week 5

#### Colin Byrnes

## Questions or Observations

1. Zines seem more related to social media than books. I thought it was telling that Pagan considers her Zines standalone works but didn't consider them a book until they were bound together and connected by her personal essays.  
2. Did Zines ever breakout of punk/underground culture?
3. How widespread is the movement to preserve Zines in libraries?
4. I was interested to learn that Gatlinburg has long been a tourist trap. My day in Gatlinburg this summer was pretty similar to Pagan's in the 90s.
