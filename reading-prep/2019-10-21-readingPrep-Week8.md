# Reading Prep: Week 8

## Questions or Observations

1. Was "What football will look like in the Future" originally posted as a standard SB Nation article with no hint of how long it was? 
2. My thoughts on e-readers vs. paper in terms of comprhension is closer to Farge's points about attiude. I didn't quite buy Jabr's points about remembering the phyisical location within a book being more helpful in gaining knowledge.
3. Is E-lit a well defined category or is it still up in the air?
