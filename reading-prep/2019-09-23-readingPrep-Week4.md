## Questions or Observations

1. Are the same Fonts used in all of the languages that have latin alphabets or are there fonts distinct to certain languages?
2. Has anywhere in Bushwick adopted the 'Bushwick' font?
3. Do Marketing/Design firms have proprietary fonts? Or are they detered by their inability to trademark anything other than the name?
