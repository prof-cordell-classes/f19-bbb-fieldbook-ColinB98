## Questions or Observations

1. I am confused by Christian Bök's Xenotext "poetry" if I understand it correctly there is nothing written unless you consider Bök's personnal chemical alphabet a language capable of literature. To me Bök's work is poetry in the metaphorical sense not in actuallity. 
2. The furture library is a really cool project. Time Capsules are always fun and adding unpublished works to a time capsule as well as growing the materials for the book make it extra special. I was curious if the Future library was taking any steps to protect forests in Norway.
3. Do altered books ever get published on a commercial scale. I noticed the Humument had a publisher but was not sure the distrobution that took place. I had always pictured altered books as indiviual works of art not reproducable like a novel.
