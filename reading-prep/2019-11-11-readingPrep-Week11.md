# Reading Prep: Week 11

## Questions or Observations

1. I think that Thinking as Handwork is too concerned with 3-D printing adversely affecting museums. The technology used by a museum is not important to its survival or cultural value. A museum's value is determined by the instituion's preservation of its artifacts and history and its positive engagement with the public. No single technology is going to bring down a museum. 
2.  I would sort the books discusssed in 'Bibliocircuitry etc.' as closer to artist books than e-books. An e-book to me exists as a digital file. A physical book with electronic elements doesn't fit the bill. 
3. These readings are good for the final discussion week of the class becasue the ideas that form the core of these two readings - reflective design and critical making - blend well this class's focus on What makes a Book a Book.
