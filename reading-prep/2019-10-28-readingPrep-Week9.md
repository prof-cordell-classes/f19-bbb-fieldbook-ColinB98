## Questions or Observations

1. First Screening - Computer poems shows to me how much work it takes to preserve something even in the digital age. Preserving a codex is a challanging process but people assume that digital files will be much easier to preserve but digital tech is reliant on much greater technology than a book to be accessed.
2. Can an author write literature without trying to? The authors of Flores's 3rd generation of e-lit rarley view themselves as creating literature. 
3. I enjoyed using the deletionist on the class webpage. the two results I got were it left every word starting with N and the other it left every "you" on the page. The how it works page was a little page, do we know the variety of poems the deletionist is capable of.
