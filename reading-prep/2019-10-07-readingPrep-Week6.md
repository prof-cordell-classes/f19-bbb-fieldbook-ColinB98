# Reading Prep: Week 6

## Questions or Observations

1. I looked up Charles Chestnutt after reading Baxter's Proscutes. This is my favorite story I've read in a while. I was really hoping that it was a true story. I was slightly dissapointed to learn it was satire but having the story's context I appreciate Chestnutt's authorship even more. 
2. I was interested in Lindsay Schmittle's AT hike and printing project. After my brief experiance with letterpress printing, found printing seems incredibly difficult and after a quick look at the final product on the Gingerly press site I have no idea how she printed the posters.
3. The Kickstarter aspect of the Schmittle's project along with the discussion of the collector's value of different books discussed in Chestnutt's story reminded me of the financial concerns around the letterpress industry. Artistic industries in general have such a different business model than the more traditonal indsutires we learn about in Business classes and it is interesting to me how letterpress and publishing in general have shifted thier business/marketing strategies over the centuries.
